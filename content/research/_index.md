## Genetic basis of virulence and persistence
We use forward genetics and experimental crosses to identify parasite loci that control virulence, persistence, and drug susceptibility in *Cryptosporidium*.

## Forward genetics and genome engineering
Our lab develops and applies scalable genetic tools, including experimental crosses, bulk segregant analysis, and genome engineering approaches, to dissect complex parasite traits.

## Host–parasite interactions and metabolism
We investigate how host environment, nutrition, and immune pressure shape parasite fitness, disease outcome, and transmission.
