        We study the genetic and transcriptomic basis of virulence and persistence in the apicomplexan parasite *Cryptosporidium*.
        
        **Our mission is to unravel how genetic variation shapes infection outcomes.**

        At the **Shaw Lab**, we combine forward genetics, experimental evolution, and transcriptomics to identify parasite factors that determine persistence and virulence.

        Based at the **University of Zurich**, we aim to build new toolkits for the field and translate basic discovery into better intervention strategies.
