  We study the genetic and transcriptomic basis of virulence and persistence in the apicomplexan parasite *Cryptosporidium*. Using forward and reverse genetics, genome engineering, and host–parasite interaction studies, we aim to discover the origins of phenotypic differences across *Cryptosporidium* strains.
